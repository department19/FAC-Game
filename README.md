# Whack a Bug!
---
Whack a Bug game is a simple game where the end user will "squash the bugs" through mouse input, point and click!

*insert image here*

## Planned Core Implementations
- A simple working point and click system to remove a "bug" when clicked on by the end user
- JS system of generating "bugs" in random spot on a set grid
- A point tally to increase for every "bug" squashed
- A timer to count down as a time limit

## Planned Advanced Implementations
- Level system
- Increasing of difficulty; additional holes, faster "bugs"

## Basic structure


### styling the grid

I originally started to use `display: grid` to form the area for the holes since it seemed the most intuitive, but switched to flexbox since my understanding of grid mechanics was was lacking.
